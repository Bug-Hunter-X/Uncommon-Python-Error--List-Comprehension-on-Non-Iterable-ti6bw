This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Python related to list comprehension and non-iterable data types.  The `bug.py` file shows a function that uses list comprehension and attempts to handle potential `TypeError` exceptions. The `bugSolution.py` offers improved error handling and illustrates how to robustly process various data types within the function. This example highlights the importance of careful type handling in Python to prevent unexpected errors.
